## What Sounds Changed:
The sounds for all doors have been switched to Jordon Nonsense sound equivalents. The main entrance sound remains unchanged as I'm not sure what to use for it.

## How to Install:

- Use any compatible mod manager for the easiest installation.

OR

- Make sure you have all dependencies installed.
- Move the `Jordons_sounds` folder from the `CustomSounds` folder into the `CustomSounds` folder within your `plugins` directory.

## List Of Replaced Sounds:


- DoorOpen1
- DoorOpen2
